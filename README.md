## Protocols

List of implemented protocols of the repository:

- [Teleportation](https://github.com/JustWhit3/quantum-algorithms/tree/main/protocols/teleportation) ([explanation](https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/entanglement-in-action#teleportation)): protocol used to send a qubit from A to B by making use of a shared entangled quantum state along with two bits of classical communication.
- [Superdense coding](https://github.com/JustWhit3/quantum-algorithms/tree/main/protocols/superdense_coding) ([explanation](https://learning.quantum-computing.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information/entanglement-in-action#superdense-coding)): protocol used to allow transmission of two classical bits using one qubit of quantum communication.
